          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Indulge in the ultimate morning comfort with our Baked French Toast, a dish that transforms simple ingredients into a decadent, crowd-pleasing masterpiece. We start with thick slices of artisanal brioche, soaked in a rich, velvety custard infused with warm vanilla and a hint of ground cinnamon. By baking it to perfection rather than pan-frying, we achieve a delightful contrast in textures: a golden, slightly crisp exterior that gives way to a center so light and pillowy it practically melts in your mouth. </p>
          <p>Whether you are hosting a festive brunch or simply elevating your weekend routine, this dish offers a sophisticated twist on a classic favorite. Each bite is a harmonious blend of buttery sweetness and aromatic spice, best enjoyed with a generous drizzle of pure maple syrup and a handful of fresh, seasonal berries. It’s more than just a meal—it’s an invitation to slow down and savor a truly gourmet breakfast experience right at your own table.</p>

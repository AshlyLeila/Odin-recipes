        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Apple Cinnamon Roll Casserole is a cozy, indulgent breakfast or dessert dish that combines the comforting flavors of warm cinnamon rolls with the sweetness of baked apples. It’s typically made by cutting refrigerated cinnamon rolls into pieces, layering them with diced apples, and baking everything together in a creamy custard or syrup mixture. As it bakes, the rolls puff up and turn golden, while the apples soften and release their juices, creating a gooey, caramel-like filling that makes each bite rich and satisfying.</p>
        <p>What makes this casserole especially appealing is its simplicity and versatility. It can be prepared ahead of time, baked fresh for brunch, or served as a sweet treat after dinner. A drizzle of icing or caramel sauce on top adds an extra layer of decadence, while a sprinkle of chopped nuts or a scoop of vanilla ice cream can elevate it even further. The combination of tender apples, spiced cinnamon, and fluffy rolls makes this dish a crowd-pleaser that feels both nostalgic and festive.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (17.5 ounce) cans cinnamon rolls, such as Pillsbury® Grands!</li>
            <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1/4 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut each cinnamon roll into 1-inch pieces and set icing aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; add cinnamon roll pieces to the dish. Dollop apple pie filling randomly among cinnamon roll pieces and pour heavy cream evenly over the casserole. </li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>

            <li>Combine butter, flour, brown sugar, oats, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon in a bowl, and use a pastry cutter or a fork to mix until large crumbs form and everything is well combined. Uncover the casserole and spread the streusel topping evenly over the top. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk icing from the package and remaining cinnamon together in a small bowl.  Drizzle over the warm casserole.</li>
